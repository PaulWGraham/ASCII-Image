# ASCII-Image

The purpose of the ASCII-Image project is basically to go from this:

to this (Hint: Zoom in on the image below):

The ASCII-Image project is comprised of two following tools:

**png2ascii.py** - A program that rerenders a PNG image into ASCII art. If a directory is supplied as input the PNGs inside it are all rerendered as ASCII art and stored in an ASCII art bundle.

**ascii2png.py** - A program that renders a PNG image that contains rendered ASCII. If an ASCII art bundle is supplied as input all of the ASCII art the bundle contains is rendered and saved.
